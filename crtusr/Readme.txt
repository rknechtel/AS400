Instrutions:

You will need to modify the CL program and DSPF source to suit your particular
User needs.  Just make changes as necessary for user classes/groups authority's 
and such.  This program was originally design for two types of users, you may 
want to provide for more types of users. Feel free to make any changes as 
necessary.  If you make  any improvements on this program I would be gratefull 
if you would send me a copy.  I am licensing this program under the GNU and 
the OSS so please do the right thing and share.... :^)

NOTE: You must run this with QSECOFR authorities!!!


==========
Compile Instructions:

Compile the CRTUSRD.DSP file   (I compiled this with RSTDSP *YES )
Then Compile the CRTUSRC.CLP program.

===============
