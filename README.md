AS400 Utilities I have written

CRTUSR - Create user 
-----------------------------------
This program allows System Administrators to easily create:
user profiles, the libraries, the source files, the directory entries, set the user
profile authorities.  The program standarizes the user profiles by generating
the user profile ID by the first and last names.  This helps in keeping User
Profiles standerdized on a system!  This program is released under the
GNU General Public License and under the OSS Open Source.
